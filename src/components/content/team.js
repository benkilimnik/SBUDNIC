As a part of the STEAM Academy throughout high school, Haley led the Green Technology House Project, which consisted of wiring a miniature house with solar panels, rechargeable batteries, and an Arduino. On the SBUDNIC team, Haley is a member of the Electrical Power System (EPS) subsystem and is responsible for designing and constructing the battery pack for the satellite alongside Brown alumnus, Shin-Ji Low.",
