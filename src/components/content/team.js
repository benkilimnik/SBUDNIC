    subtitle: "The resident space guy on the School of Engineering faculty since 2002. Brown AB 1976, PhD 1981 in engineering. Started building small satellites with Amsat while at Brown in the 1970s. During the 1980s and 1990s wrote several books and book chapters, taught professional courses and started a company all dedicated to making small satellites a reality. In addition to working at Brown I'm a visiting professor at La Sapienza in Rome, Italy where I live with my wife, Esther. I raced bicycles at Brown and still an avid rider and bike commuter in both countries.",

    subtitle: "Haley Rose Flores is a first-year undergraduate student at Brown University studying Computer Science and Engineering. This is Haleyâ€™s first involvement in an engineering project at Brown University. During the summer before her senior year, Haley conducted research at the New Jersey Institute of Technology studying the process of self-assembly of multilayer graphene in water-containing impurities under the supervision of Dr. Dibakar Datta and Vidushi Sharma. As a part of the STEAM Academy throughout high school, Haley led the Green Technology House Project, which consisted of wiring a miniature house with solar panels, rechargeable batteries, and an Arduino. On the SBUDNIC team, Haley is a member of the Electrical Power System (EPS) subsystem and is responsible for designing and constructing the battery pack for the satellite alongside Brown alumnus, Shin-Ji Low.",
