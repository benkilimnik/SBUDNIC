            SBUDNIC is a group of Brown University students developing a cube
            satellite for launch using only terrestrial parts like Arduino Uno.
            We plan to make all of our designs open-source. SBUDNIC emerged from
            Professor Rick Fleeter’s “Design of Space Systems” class, ENGN1760.

              Why not? We aspire to be one of the fastest sketch-to-launch
              developments of a 3U cubesat. Period. SBUDNIC’s total budget is
              approximately $10,000 USD; we are working to meet our aggressive
              timeline by utilizing as many terrestrial components as possible.

              We are a team of Brown University undergraduate and graduate
              students supported by several dedicated and generous European
              professional partners. About half of us are studying some form of
              engineering. The other half of us come from fields like economics,
              international relations, and sculpture. This is a massive
              interdisciplinary effort.
